Overview: The site will be a blog for news relating to the Lego company which will pertain to various events and
new products being released. It won't have many pages, consisting of the main page, an articles page, an 
about us page, and a link to the lego website. It would be more static, with it's responsiveness mainly 
pertaining to opening articles and managing them with types of news and a search bar.
Goals: The main goals of the site would be to help inform people who enjoy lego about the things the lego 
company would be working on.
Target Users: Believe it or not the site would be targeted more towards adults, as it would help them be 
prepared for their kids who would badger them as well as help adult lego builders find challenging sets to
make, such as a large town piece.
Content: The main page will have a introduction, a most popular article, a few recent articles, and tabs for 
the other pages. The articles page has a list of articles, a search bar to search for specific ones, and a 
few pieces to filter the articles. The about us page will show the people who work on the site, inclucing 
names, email, and phone numbers. The final one is literally just a portal to the official lego website.
Similar Sites: The main site used for inspiration was actually a Disney blog that caught up on Disney related
news, making it a good starting point. In it, there would be various articles about the state of Disney and 
it's products, making it relevant for any Disney fans who are searching for a 3rd party view on something.
I am looking to make something similar but with lego.
